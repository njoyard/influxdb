# Converting b1 and bz1 shards to tsm1

`influx_tsm` is a tool for converting b1 and bz1 shards to tsm1
format. Converting shards to tsm1 format results in a very significant
reduction in disk usage, and significantly improved write-throughput,
when writing data into those shards.

Conversion can be controlled on a database-by-database basis. By
default a database is backed up before it is converted, allowing you
to roll back any changes. Because of the backup process, ensure the
host system has at least as much free disk space as the disk space
consumed by the _data_ directory of your InfluxDB system.

The tool automatically ignores tsm1 shards, and can be run
idempotently on any database.

Conversion is an offline process, and the InfluxDB system must be
stopped during conversion. However the conversion process reads and
writes shards directly on disk and should be fast.

## Steps

Follow these steps to perform a conversion.

* Identify the databases you wish to convert. You can convert one or more databases at a time. By default all databases are converted.
* Decide on parallel operation. By default the conversion operation peforms each operation in a serial manner. This minimizes load on the host system performing the conversion, but also takes the most time. If you wish to minimize the time conversion takes, enable parallel mode. Conversion will then perform as many operations as possible in parallel, but the process may place significant load on the host system (CPU, disk, and RAM, usage will all increase).
* Stop all write-traffic to your InfluxDB system.
* Restart the InfluxDB service and wait until all WAL data is flushed to disk -- this has completed when the system responds to queries. This is to ensure all data is present in shards.
* Stop the InfluxDB service. It should not be restarted until conversion is complete.
* Run conversion tool. Depending on the size of the data directory, this might be a lengthy operation. Consider running the conversion tool under a "screen" session to avoid any interruptions.
* Unless you ran the conversion tool as the same user as that which runs InfluxDB, then you may need to set the correct read-and-write permissions on the new tsm1 directories.
* Restart node and ensure data looks correct.
* If everything looks OK, you may then wish to remove or archive the backed-up databases.
* Restart write traffic.

$ # restart node, verify data

$ sudo rm -r /tmp/influxdb_backup
```

Note that the tool first lists the shards that will be converted,
before asking for confirmation. You can abort the conversion process
at this step if you just wish to see what would be converted, or if
the list of shards does not look correct.

__WARNING:__ If you run the `influx_tsm` tool as a user other than the
`influxdb` user (or the user that the InfluxDB process runs under),
please make sure to verify the shard permissions are correct prior to
starting InfluxDB. If needed, shard permissions can be corrected with
the `chown` command. For example:

```
sudo chown -R influxdb:influxdb /var/lib/influxdb
```

## Rolling back a conversion

After a successful backup (the message `Database XYZ backed up` was
logged), you have a duplicate of that database in the _backup_
directory you provided on the command line. If, when checking your
data after a successful conversion, you notice things missing or
something just isn't right, you can "undo" the conversion:

- Shut down your node (this is very important)
- Remove the database's directory from the influxdb `data` directory (default: `~/.influxdb/data/XYZ` for binary installations or `/var/lib/influxdb/data/XYZ` for packaged installations)
- Copy (to really make sure the shard is preserved) the database's directory from the backup directory you created into the `data` directory.

Using the same directories as above, and assuming a database named `stats`:

```
$ sudo rm -r /var/lib/influxdb/data/stats
$ sudo cp -r /tmp/influxdb_backup/stats /var/lib/influxdb/data/
$ # restart influxd node
```
